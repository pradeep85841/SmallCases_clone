# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Fetch](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)
